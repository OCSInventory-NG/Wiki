# OCS Inventory NG - GreenIT Documentation

## Introduction

### What is GreenIT ?
GreenIT aims to minimize the negative effects of IT operations on the environment by designing, manufacturing, operating and disposing of servers, PCs and other computer-related products in an environmentally friendly manner. The motives behind green IT practices include reducing the use of hazardous materials, maximizing energy efficiency during a product's lifetime, and promoting the biodegradability of unused and outdated products.

### What's it for ?
Our GreenIT module is used to retreive consumption data of IT infrastructure and estimate a cost of it. Thanks to that, a company can measure his own infrastructure and take choices to try to reduce his IT cost.
