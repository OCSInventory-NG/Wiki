`Note : Since 2.9.2 version, some LDAP configuration fields has been changed. Please, read the documentation` [Manage authentification with LDAP](../04.Management-console-and-its-advanced-features/Synchronization-between-OCS-and-LDAP.md)

## Delete existing plugins

If you have plugins installed delete this plugins prior the update otherwise you might have problems with or after re-install them.

Go to the plugin manager and delete them you may also need delete the configuration in :    
_/etc/ocsinventory-server/plugins_

## Backup existing configuration

Before you start it´s better to stop the web server that nobody could do changes after you backed up the files.

```
service apache2 stop
```
You need to backup the following configuration files:
1. Apache files:    
* ~/apache2/conf-available/z-ocsinventory-server.conf
* ~/apache2/conf-available/zz-ocsinventory-restapi.conf
* ~/apache2/conf-available/ocsinventory-reports.conf
2. OCS configuration:
* /usr/share/ocsinventory-reports/ocsreports/dbconfig.inc.php

It´s recommended to create a folder where you store all backed up files :
```
mkdir /home/backup_ocs
```
Then copy the files to the backup folder :
```
cp /etc/apache2/conf-available/z-ocsinventory-server.conf
/etc/apache2/conf-available/zz-ocsinventory-restapi.conf /etc/apache2/conf-available/ocsinventory-reports.conf /home/backup_ocs/ && cp /usr/share/ocsinventory-reports/ocsreports/dbconfig.inc.php /home/backup_ocs/
```
If your scared about losing data then better backup your database, but theoretical this is not necessary.
```
mysqldump -u ocs -p --all-databases > /home/backup_ocs/ocsdbbackup.sql
```

## Update the existing installation

Download the last release of OCS from the [Website](https://ocsinventory-ng.org/?page_id=1548&lang=en) or [here](https://github.com/OCSInventory-NG/OCSInventory-ocsreports/releases) from github.    
Unpack it :
```
tar –xvzf OCSNG_UNIX_SERVER-2.x.x.tar.gz
cd OCSNG_UNIX_SERVER-2.x.x
```
Run “setup.sh” installer. During the installer, default choice is presented between []. For example, [y]/n means that “y” (yes) is the default choice, and “n” (no) is the other choice.
```
sh setup.sh
```
**`Note: Installer writes a log file “ocs_server_setup.log” in the same directory. If you encounter any error, please refer to this log for detailed error message.`**


## Restore backed up configuration and start

Restore the backed up files from above 
```
cd /home/backup_ocs
cp ocsinventory-reports.conf z-ocsinventory-server.conf zz-ocsinventory-restapi.conf /etc/apache2/conf-available/ && cp dbconfig.inc.php /usr/share/ocsinventory-reports/ocsreports/
```
Don´t forget to delete the install.php in the install dir
```
rm /usr/share/ocsinventory-reports/ocsreports/install.php
```
Start apache webserver
```
service apache2 start
```

Sometimes it's required to update the database via the webconsole, simply click update on the webconsole.
