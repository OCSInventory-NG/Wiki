# Profiles administration of the administration interface

Profiles of the web interface in OCS 2.0 are handled as files. They are storage by default in

    ~/ocsreports/config/profiles/

All changes made to a profile cause a backup of the original file. This backup is stored by default in

    ~/ocsreports/plugins/main_sections/conf/old_conf

You can choose to store these files elsewhere by going to _Config_ then click on _Config_ and _Interface_ tab.
