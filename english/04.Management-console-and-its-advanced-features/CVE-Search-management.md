# CVE Reporting

CVE Reporting has ben added in release 2.7 of OCS Inventory. 
By enabling this feature, OCS Inventory can automatically query a 
[CVE-search](http://cve-search.github.io/cve-search/) server for 
vulnerabilities that may apply to your inventoried softwares.

**`Warning : CVE Reporting is a feature for informational purposes. OCS Inventory does not guarantee the accuracy of the informations provided.`**

## Prerequisites

In order to use CVE Reporting feature, it's recommended to install CVE-search server.

To install and configure the CVE-search server, please refer to its documentation : [CVE-search](http://cve-search.github.io/cve-search/).

To access the CVE-search management configuration, you need to enable the advanced configuration :

* Navigate to `Configuration > General configuration > Server`
* Set  `ADVANCE_CONFIGURATION` to `ON`
* Click on `Update`

## Configuring the CVE-Search management

As administrator, go to the menu `Configuration > General configuration`, 
and click on the "CVE-search management" entry in the left navigation pane:

There are 3 settings :

* **VULN_CVESEARCH_ENABLE** : Define wether the integration is enabled or not (default : Disabled);
* **VULN_CVESEARCH_HOST** : Define the URL of the cve-search server to be queried.
* **VULN_BAN_LIST** : Select software categories that you do not want to process. When a sofwtare category has been added to VULN_BAN_LIST, All CVE for software in this category will not be processed by OCS Inventory.
* **VULN_CVESEARCH_LINK** : Enable display of redirect link to CVE details page.
* **VULN_CVESEARCH_VERBOSE** : Enable verbose mode in CVE Crontab, can help in a debugging process.
* **VULN_CVE_EXPIRE_TIME** : Time of validity of a CVE after OCS Inventory scan. After this time, the CVE entry will become invalid and will be re-processed by OCS.
* **VULN_CVE_DELAY_TIME** : Time delay between each CVE api call.

## Configure CronTab

In your server, configure a CronTab to call the file cron_cve.php in

    cd /usr/share/ocsinventory-reports/ocsreports/crontab/ && php cron_cve.php

**cron_cve.php** call cve-search server and get all CVE by software publisher, name and version.

**`Note`**`: It's recommended to execute the crontab at night. CVE cleaning is done automatically with cron_cve.php.`

The crontab use software data to retrieve the CVE. It's recommended to launch **cron_all_software.php** before in order to have the data up to date.

## Features

When CVE-Search has been enabled and crontab cron_cve.php has been executed, click on ```Inventory > CVE Reporting ```.
